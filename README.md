ByteMe
Consent Intelligence System
A clause-level AI system that analyzes digital consent agreements (Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policies) and translates them into structured, understandable risk insights for users.

Overview
Digital consent documents are often long, complex, and difficult to understand. Most users accept them without fully reading or comprehending the risks involved.
ByteMe addresses this problem by building an AI-powered consent intelligence system that:
-Segments policy documents into individual clauses
-Classifies clauses into structured risk categories
-Assigns interpretable risk labels
-Presents simplified explanations for users

The goal is to improve transparency, trust, and informed digital decision-making.
