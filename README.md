AI Policy & Consent Auditor <br>
An AI-powered system that analyzes loan agreements and policy documents to improve comprehension, highlight risks, and provide actionable recommendations for students. <br>

Problem Statement: <br>
Many students sign loan agreements and legal documents without fully understanding: <br>
Financial penalties <br>
Repayment conditions <br>
Guarantor obligations <br>
Hidden risk clauses <br>

Legal language is complex, dense, and difficult to interpret without professional training. <br>
This project aims to bridge that gap using AI-driven clause extraction, simplification, and risk evaluation. <br>

Project Objective <br>
To develop an AI system that: <br>
Extracts critical clauses from loan agreements <br>
Explains them in simple, student-friendly language <br>
Classifies risk levels (Low / Medium / High) <br>
Provides actionable recommendations <br>
The system focuses on decision-support, not just summarization. <br>
